[These axioms were part of a presentation and panel discussion on "Bringing Making into Learning" at the Roxbury Innovation Center on 2/8/2017]

**By Making Things, We Learn What We Can Make Things**

Furniture, software, political systems—anything you build drags theory into
contact with reality.  Reality is generous with feedback -- each broken prototype lights a path to the next version and proves complexity
is just lots of simple parts playing nicely together.  Learning isn't something you do to get ready for the "real world."  The whole world is real and you never stop learning.

**Teaching Always Happens Somewhere**

Every lesson sits inside layers—classroom, institution, neighborhood, society.
Those layers tint every interaction.  Middle-schoolers, grad students, adult
night-owls: different clocks, different stakes.  Backgrounds and languages shape
how learners meet the material, the teacher, and each other.

**Context Shapes Possibility**

Space design *is* pedagogy.  Layouts, schedules, rules, and tools either invite
voice or smother it.  When students help pick readings, map projects, and move
furniture, the room says, *We trust you.*  Trust breeds risk-taking, and risk
breeds real work.

**The Teacher Helps, but the Student Does the Learning**

Teaching is complicated. A teacher msynthesizes interpersonal relationships, community-building, content-area expertise to figure out how to communicate ideas and design learning experiences.  But in the end, no matter how hard they work, or how clever the lesson or project, it's the students who do the hard work of interpreting and organizing information and turning it into knowledge and understanding. 
Teaching Always Happens Som

**Teaching Young People Is Childcare**

Regulations may split “education” from “childcare,” kids don’t.  Snacks,
laughter, quiet check-ins—these are not downtime; they are the ground floor of
learning.  Kids learn when they are safe, comfortable, and cared for and they
take risks when they trust the grown-ups enough to know they'll be OK.

**You Learn to Teach the Same Way You Learn Everything Else: By Doing It**

Teaching is a craft.  Repetition sharpens instinct: when to zoom
out, when to drop an analogy, how to see the line between confusion and
anxiety.  Experience bends theory; theory steers the next attempt.  Round and
round, better and better.
