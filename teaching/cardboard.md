summary: Cardboard is easy to cut, strong, and everywhere!  It's the perfect materials for building games, toys, and other inventions.  In this class we'll design and build a variety of cardboard contraptions, from marble mazes to mechanical automata.  In the process we'll learn to use basic tools and explore design, building, and simple mechanics.  Run for Kindergarten through 3rd grade students for Prospect Hill Academy STEAM Saturdays.
