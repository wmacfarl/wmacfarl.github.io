summary: We will learn the basics of 3D modelling and animation with a piece of software called Maya.  Maya is a standard professional tool for producing 3D art and animation for movies, video-games and many other domains.  Our primary resources for the class will be various step-by-step tutorial videos, and the class will be as much about the process of following instructions and using documentation to learn a complex tool and skill as it will be about 3D modelling itself.
