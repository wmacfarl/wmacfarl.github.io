"Built From Scratch" is a series of short tutorial videos documenting the design and programming of a video game project using the Scratch programming language.  The series was started using Scratch 2.0 and is currently on-hold with a plan to start it again from the beginning with the new Scratch 3.0 environment after it is released.
