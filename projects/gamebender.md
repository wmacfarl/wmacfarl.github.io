<h2>Play. Bend. Code.</h2>

GameBender is a radical new game console, where you modify ("bend") games while you play them. It unleashes wild creativity during gameplay, and allows a path into coding that looks more like a party or an art class and less like homework.

GameBender was primarily designed as a video-game console and a consumer product.  I joined the team in the summer of 2019, three years into the project's development, to work on adapting the GameBender console software for use in formal and informal educational settings -- classrooms, museums, afterschool clubs, community centers, and more.

Because JoyLabz is a small organization, this work has touched on all aspects of the project.  I began by developing curricular material for teachers -- programming prompts, sample code, and projects designed to be modified and built using the GameBender coding toolset.
